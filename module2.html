        <li>Add shrimp and coconut cream (optional):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you're adding shrimp, add them to the pan at this point and cook for about 2-3 minutes until they turn pink and are cooked through.</li>

            <li>Let the Bicol Express simmer for another 5-10 minutes on low heat, allowing the flavors to meld together. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little water or broth to reach your desired consistency.</li>
